#+TITLE: Zdeta
* Presentation
Zdeta is a little High-level language inspired by Ruby, Python, Ocaml etc. The
compiler is written in C. It is meant to be simple, beginner-friendly and not frustrating.
I had the idea of creating Zdeta after trying Rustlang, I was very frustrated
because of all the errors.
* Exapmles
Here is the classical Hello world in Zdeta:
#+BEGIN_SRC
print "Hello World!"
#+END_SRC
You can notice that there is no parentheses between the function and the
argument like in ocaml or ruby.
